Hello! My name is Julian B Mackenzie. I am a Computer Science undergrad at the University of Illinois @ Chicago.
I will be graduating in May of 2022 with a BS in Computer Science.


I am interested in software engineering, web app development, game development, and UI/UX specialization.


As far as my progress toward those interests go, I have a decent understanding of software engineering and the components
at play in that field, as well as a growing knowledge of game development (writing, art design, team organization, etc.).
I hope to begin learning to create web applications soon.


I have a college-level experience in C++/C, Java, and Python, as well as knowledge in SQL and GML.
I am a quick learner, have excellent written and oral communication skills, and in leadership I value a team-focused environment.


I am always open to project and work inquiries!
Contact me at julianbmackenzie@gmail.com, or using my school email, jbm5@uic.edu.
The latter I am likely to see quicker, but once I graduate that will no longer be available.
